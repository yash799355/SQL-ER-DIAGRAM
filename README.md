Centralized College Database
Overview
A college has multiple academic departments, such as the Department of English, Mathematics, History, etc. Each department offers a variety of courses, and instructors can teach more than one course. For example, a professor may teach both Statistics and Calculus.
As a Mathematics department student, you can enroll in both courses, and each course can have multiple students but only one instructor to avoid overlaps. This project involves creating a system to manage student records, courses, and faculty details in a college. It provides hands-on experience in designing a database for a real-world scenario, illustrating how students, courses, and faculty are interconnected.
